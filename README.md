# ThesisCode

In this repo you can find some Jupyter Notebooks with data analysis and personal elaborations for my Thesis.

- **Direct.ipynb** contains the comparison between existing tail protection indexes related to the S&P 500.
- **StratSimVeq.ipynb** and **Garch.ipynb** contain the modified VEQTOR startegy and the GARCH-based strategy I developed and presented in my Thesis.
- **Functions_thesis** contains some simple function I've written and used to obtain performance metrics for the strategies.

All the data used can be found in the excel file Data_tesi.
